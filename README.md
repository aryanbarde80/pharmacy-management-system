# KicksUp (PharmaSys) — Flask + Firebase

This repository contains a small Flask app serving the static pages as templates and wired to Firebase (Firestore) with a mocked fallback when Firebase is not configured.

Getting started

1. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Provide Firebase credentials (optional)
- Create a Firebase project and a service account with Firestore access.
- Download the service account JSON and set an environment variable on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = 'C:\path\to\serviceAccount.json'
```

If no credentials are provided the app will use mocked sample data.

3. Run the app

```powershell
python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000

Notes
- Templates live in `templates/` and are basic Jinja templates that render data from Firestore or mock data.
- To actually use Firebase, ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` points to your service account JSON.

Deployment (Render)

1) One-click deploy
- Push your code to GitHub (already done).
- Open this link in your browser and follow the prompts:
  https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/DAVIXSX/pharmacy-management-system

2) What the blueprint does
- Creates a Web Service with Python runtime.
- Installs dependencies from requirements.txt.
- Starts the server with: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

3) Environment configuration (in Render dashboard)
- FLASK_SECRET_KEY: already autogenerated by the blueprint (you can rotate later).
- FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET: optional, set to your Firebase storage bucket if you use file storage.
- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: optional. If you use a Google service account JSON, upload it as a Secret File in Render and set this variable to its mount path (e.g., /etc/secrets/firebase.json).

4) After deploy
- Render will build and start your service. When it’s live, you’ll get a public URL.
- If Firebase credentials are not set, the app will run but some data will be empty; set credentials to enable full functionality.
